# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Purpose

## Results

### Data Preprocessing
#### •	target variable : IS_SUCCESSFUL
#### •	features: APPLICATION_TYPE
#### •	variables that were removed: EIN and NAME

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
#### • neurons: 131, layers: 3, activation functions: 3 the large number of neurons and layers was chosen to allow the model more opportunities to find trends in the data set

#### • Target model performance was not achieved, it was below the accuracy percentage target: 75%
#### • The number of neurons and activation functions were altered to try and increase model performance
